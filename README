BECK
====
- Compile beck.go and save it somewhere on your path
- Create .config/beck/source a symbolic link to the directory to backup
- Create .config/beck/backup a symbolic link to the backup directory (hopefully on a different volume from source)
- Write in .config/beck/exclude the list of things you want to exclude from the backup
- Write in .config/beck/include the list of things you want to include in the backup
- run ./beck back to execute backup, ./beck check to check last backup

=========
AUTOTRASH
=========

- Just set autotrash to run periodically in crontab, the amount of time files are preserved can be changed by editing autotrash (it's 3 days)
